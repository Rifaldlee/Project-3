                        So Therefore, choosing the best processor to support work using a computer or laptop is very important for users. Currently, for computer processors, there are 2 competitors, namely AMD and Intel. Intel processors have the advantage

                        which can be stored for an indefinite period of time depending on the age and maintenance of the Storage device itself.
                        Currently, Storage devices continue to be developed both in terms of device types, and innovations in size.
                        Because the Storage device over time has a smaller size.
                        Examples of storage on a computer are ssd, hard disk, M.2 ssd, M.2 NVME. The faster the reading ability, the more expensive the price</p>
